# Restaurant Review: Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree project
---

In **Restaurant Reviews** project, I incrementally converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, I took a static design that lacks accessibility and converted to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for my users. In **Stage Two** I took the responsive, accessible design you built in Stage One and connect it to an external server. I used asynchronous JavaScript to request JSON data from the server. I stored data received from the server in an offline database using IndexedDB, which created an app shell architecture. In **Stage Three** I added a form to allow users to create their own reviews. If the app is offline, your form will defer updating to the remote database until a connection is established. Finally, I optimized your site to meet Lighthouse benchmarks for Progressive Web App, Accessibility and Performance.
